Just like a real flashlight, the entire UI consists of a single button.  Pressing it will turn the light on and off.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't have any other features, or attempt to work with obscure devices or old android versions.  So far it's only been tested on a _Samsung Droid Charge_ running _Android 2.3.6_, but it should work on most common devices."}
